-- This has a number of benefits, we're able to isolate our validation
-- requirements into smaller components that are simpler to maintain and verify.
-- It also allows for greater reuse and it also means that validation is not
-- duplicated across the application, maybe incorrectly.

-- ``Request`` from the Wai library and turn it into something our application

-- If we find that we need more information to handle a request, or we have a
-- new type of request that we'd like to handle then we update the ``RqType``
-- structure and the compiler will let us know which parts of our application
-- are affected.
--
-- Reduction of concerns such that each section of the application only deals
-- with a small piece is one of the benefits of developing in this way.
--
-- For now, return a made-up value for each of the responses as we don't have
-- any persistent storage. Plain text responses that contain "X not implemented
-- yet" should be sufficient.
